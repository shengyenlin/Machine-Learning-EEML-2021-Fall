How to run this program: (read img from directory)
- put the `model_best.pth` file in the same directory as HW3_b06702064.ipynb
- **run ALL the cells in HW3_b06702064.ipynb before the "讀取npy檔案來預測結果" section** (if you don't want to re-train the model, just run validation and testing sections)
- the tuning result will show on your terminal and a file called "submission.csv" will be created for kaggle submission.

How to run this program: (read img from numpy files)
- put the `X_train.npy`, `X_test.npy`, `y_train.npy` file in the same directory as HW3_b06702064.ipynb
- **run ALL the cells in HW3_b06702064.ipynb after the "讀取npy檔案來預測結果" section** (if you don't want to re-train the model, just run validation and testing sections)
