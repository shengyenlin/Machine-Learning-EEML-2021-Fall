    - best_RNN_model.pth
    - best_w2v_model.model
    - train_label.csv
    - test.csv
- how to make inference on testing set with the best model
    - Run all the code **before** the "training record" section \
    *The "training recrod" is only for displaying the training process when I'm writing this homework*
